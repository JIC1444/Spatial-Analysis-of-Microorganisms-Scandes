# Project Overview
This analysis was done as part of a larger project, where given some data from researchers in the Scandes Mountains in Norway on the bacteria and fungi present at 8 different sites in the mountains, 
analyse the given data and contribute a new insight, filling a gap in the literature.

##### _Data Privacy: Due to limitations with the source of the data, it cannot be released in conjunction with the analysis file, however my figures can still be shared on this page._

All graphs are plotted temperature on the x-axis and precipitation on the y-axis. The graph shows three vertical lines, which align with the elevational trend for these sites; the from left to right the sites increase in elevation. 
The closer a phylum node to a location node, the greater the count found there.
The top row is the bacteria phyla, with the left image displaying all of the phyla in the study. The right image has had all of the central phyla removed from
